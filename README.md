I developed the eKart website using Angular and Bootstrap to create a dynamic and user-friendly e-commerce platform. The project features a responsive navbar, a featured product carousel, and neatly organized product sections using Bootstrap cards. Angular components ensure a modular and maintainable structure. Future improvements may include backend integration, user authentication, and advanced filtering options to enhance functionality.
